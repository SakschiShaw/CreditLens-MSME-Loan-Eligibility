 CreditLens – MSME Loan Eligibility & Risk Pre-Screening 

Project Overview
CreditLens is an end-to-end Business Analyst portfolio project built in the BFSI lending domain.  
The objective of the project is to automate and analyze MSME loan eligibility and risk pre-screening, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making for banks/NBFCs.

This project demonstrates the complete BA lifecycle—from requirement gathering and Jira user stories to data analysis and Power BI dashboards.

 Business Problem
 Manual loan screening in BFSI organizations leads to:
 High processing time
 Inconsistent eligibility decisions
 Limited visibility into risk drivers
 Poor SLA tracking

CreditLens addresses these gaps through structured requirements, data-driven KPIs, and role-based dashboards.
